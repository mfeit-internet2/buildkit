# Universal builder for RPM and Debian packages

This includable Makefile automatically builds packages for Red Hat-
and Debian-derived systems depending on the environment.

The sources, patches and packaging instructions live in a directory
called the _package directory_ that serves as the root of everything
for that package.  A typical build would consist of multiple package
directories built in dependency order.

## Installation

RPM systems require the following packages preinstalled:

 * TODO: Write this.

Debian systems require the following packages preinstalled:

 * devscripts
 * equivs

The package uses itself to do a build and install, so simply running
`make cbic` (clean, build, install, re-clean) in its package directory
will get the job done.


## Preparing The Package Directory

The package directory contains a number of files and subdirectories
that comprise everything needed to build the package.


### Makefile

For all packages, create a `Makefile` in the package directory
containing the following:

```
# Makefile for any package
inclulde make/unibuild.make
```


### Sources

Source code may be in the form of a tarball downloaded from another
source or a directory containing the source code.


#### Tarball

A tarball containing the sources for the package should be placed in
the package directory and named using the customary
_PACKAGE_-_VERSION_.tar.gz format (e.g., `foomatic-2.9.38.tar.gz`) .

Place the RPM spec and `debian` directory in the package directory
alongside the tarball.

For example:
```
ls -R foomatic
foomatic:
debian  foomatic-2.9.38.tar.gz  drop-in.spec  Makefile

foomatic/debian:
changelog  compat  control  copyright  rules  source

foomatic/debian/source:
format
```

#### Source Directory

For packages whose sources are developed locally (i.e., are not
distributed as tarballs from another source), the sources may be
placed in a subdirectory the package directory named for the package.

The Makefile will locate the RPM spec or `debian` directory within the
source directory if one exists.  Note that there must be exactly one
`.spec` file or `debian` directory within the source tree or the build
will fail.

For RPM specs, the `Source0` tag should be
`%{name}-%{version}.tar.gz`.  The Makefile will automatically create
the tarball as part of the packaging process.

A typical package directory using a source directory would be laid out
like this:

```
ls -R foomatic
foomatic/:
Makefile  foomatic

foomatic/foomatic:
debian  foomatic.1  foomatic.c  foomatic.spec  Makefile

foomatic/debian:
changelog  compat   control  copyright  patches  postinst
postrm     preinst  prerm    rules      source

foomatic/foomatic/debian/source:
format
```

### Patches

Files containing modifications to be made to the sources during the
build should be placed in the `unibuild-packaging` directory, named so
they will sort into the order in which they should be applied.  For
example:

```
foomatic-01-divide-by-zero.patch
foomatic-02-segfault.patch
```
#### Debian

The names of the patches should be listed in the
`debian/patches/series` file but not placed in the `debian/patches`
directory unless they are Debian-specific modifications.  The Makefile
will place them during the build.


#### RPM

The RPM spec must list the patches in the header section and apply
them in the proper order:

```
Patch0:  foomatic-01-divide-by-zero.patch
Patch1:  foomatic-02-segfault.patch
  ...
%prep
%setup -q -n %{name}-%{version}
%patch0 -p1
%patch1 -p1
```



## Building the Package

The package can be built by running `make` in the package directory.
The default behavior is to build the package, but there are several
useful targets available:


| Target | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `build` | `b` | Build the package.  This is the default target.  See note about `sudo` below.|
| `install` | `i` | Install the package forcibly.  See note about `sudo` below.|
| `dump` | `d` | Dump the contents of the built packages. |
| `clean` | `c` | Remove all by-products of the build process. |
| | `cb` | Clean and build. |
| | `cbd` | Clean, build and dump. |
| | `cbi` | Clean, build and install. |
| | `cbic` | Clean, build and install and forced re-clean. |
| | `cbdc` | Clean, build, dump and forced re-clean. |


**NOTE:** The `build` and `install` targets will use `sudo(8)` to
acquire superuser privileges required to install any build or runtime
dependencies.  It is recommended that this be enabled in a
frictionless mode (i.e., without having to interactively provide a
password) for maximum build throughput.

**NOTE:** The `r` (RPM dump), `cbr` (clean, build, RPM dump) and
`cbrc` (claen, build, RPM dump, clean) targets that were present in
older versions of this template are deprecated and have been mapped to
the same functions as `d`, `cbd` and `cbdc`.


## By-Products

The build process yields three by-products in the package directory:

`BUILD` - The directory where the build takes place.

`PRODUCTS` - Finished products (e.g., RPMs or DEBs).

`unibuild-log` - A log of what transpired during the build process.
