# Build Order for Unibuild
#
#
# This file is preprocessed with the M4 macro processor and then
# all blank lines and comments are removed.
#
# Packages must be listed in an order where dependent packages are
# built after their dependencies.
#
#
# Options that can be added to a package line:
#
#  --bundle b   Include the package in bundle b and not the default
#               full bundle.
#
# The following macros are provided to use in determining whether or
# not to build a package:
#
# OS         Operating system, per 'uname -s'       Linux, Darwin
# FAMILY     OS family, empty if not applicable     RHEL, Debian
# DISTRO     OS distribution (LSB ID)               RHEL, CentOS, Oracle, Debian, Ubuntu
# RELEASE    Distribution release                   7.8.2003
# MAJOR      Major part of RELEASE                  7
# MINOR      Minor part of RELEASE                  8
# ARCH       System architecture, per 'uname -m'    x86_64, armhf
# PACKAGING  Type of packaging on this system       rpm, deb
#
#
# Examples of making decisions based on these macros:
#
# ifelse(DISTRO/MAJOR,CentOS/7,centos-7-only-thing)
#
# ifelse(FAMILY/MAJOR,Debian/9,,
#        FAMILY/ARCH,Debian/arm64,,
#        FAMILY/ARCH,Debian/ppc64el,,
#        non-debian-9-or-arm64-or-ppc64el-thing))
#
# Note that there is no need to make decisions for RPM- or Debian-only
# builds in this file; if there is no packaging information for
# whatever packaging applies on this system, it will not be built.
